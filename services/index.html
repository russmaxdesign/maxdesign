<p>We bring you extensive experience in planning, designing and developing websites, offering a complete service from concept to completion.</p>

<p>Whether your site is large or small, our team of specialists will make sure it is structured the right way and has the right content to attract visitors and keep them reading.</p>

<h2>Training</h2>

<p>Max Design provides engaging, activity-based training in Responsive Web Design, CSS, HTML, and Accessibility. Training can be delivered online or in person, and combines explanation, hands-on exercises, and real-world examples to help teams build confidence and practical skills they can apply immediately.</p>

<h2>Design systems</h2>

<p>We help organisations plan, create, and maintain design systems that scale. This includes establishing design tokens, components, documentation, governance models, and contribution processes that keep teams aligned. We also support organisations in leading or maturing existing design systems to improve consistency, accessibility, and long-term sustainability.</p>

<h2>User testing</h2>

<p>Usability testing involves observing people interacting with websites or web applications to understand what works well and where improvements are needed. We work with clients to test prototypes and live products throughout the development cycle, with a strong focus on testing with people who have lived experience of disability. This ensures your digital products are genuinely inclusive and usable by the widest possible audience.</p>

<h2>User experience design</h2>

<p>User experience design is about improving the usability, clarity, and overall satisfaction of a digital product. It includes visual design, information architecture, structure and labelling, usability, and interaction patterns. We work closely with clients to design websites and applications that support user goals, streamline key tasks, and create a smooth, intuitive journey from start to finish.</p>
