  <h2>Let go and allow users to control their own experience</h2>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>A forgotten past</h3>
  <p>Five years ago I was an internet criminal - hunted by the police. </p>
  <p>"Australian web designer steals Australian Senator's children!"</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>The game</h3>

</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>The email</h3>
  <p>"This is to formally let you know that I am instituting proceedings against you for defamation in the Supreme Court of Queensland . The Federal Police will be involved to track this website if I do not receive a response within 24 hours."</p>
  <p>John Herron Minister for A.T.S.I.Affairs</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>About Lisa Miller</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Honours degree in sexual selection</li>
    <li>Web Research at the Australian Museum</li>
    <li>Owner of RedQueen</li>
    <li>Project manager at Red Square</li>
    <li>Forward thinker</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>A journey</h3>
  <p>This presentation describes a journey that Lisa Miller and I embarked on - using the Australian Museum website to: </p>
  <p>"Explore ways that we could let go and allow users to control their own experience"</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Relevance</h3>
  <p>Some of these ideas may be relevant to you and others not.</p>
  <p>You may have seen some of these ideas before.</p>
  <p>This is not a complete solution.</p>
  <p>This is simply a discussion about a range of ideas and about the journey itself.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Withholding judgement</h3>
  <p>Lisa and I made this journey in small steps.</p>
  <p>We took our time.</p>
  <p>But more importantly, we explored ideas without judgement.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3> Background </h3>
  <p>The Australian Museum website comprises of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>115,000 total files</li>
    <li>3,000 - folders</li>
    <li>43,000 pages</li>
    <li>130 sections</li>
    <li>12 websites</li>
    <li>4 portals</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Existing problems</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Some content is <strong>hard</strong> to find</li>
    <li>Some content is <strong>old</strong>, out of date</li>
    <li>The front page doesn't <strong>represent</strong> the depth of content on the site</li>
    <li>The navigation systems are <strong>illogical</strong></li>
    <li>And the content is often <strong>dull</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Funnily enough, these points make the word "horid"</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Time to change</h3>
  <p>Late last year, the Australian Museum web team decided it was time to rebuild the Museum's site.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Initial aims</h3>
  <p>The web team's aim was to:</p>
  <p>"Create a series of intuitive portals that would allow users to get to content quickly and easily".</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Initial directions</h3>
  <p>We began a range of processes that included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stock take</strong> of existing content</li>
    <li><strong>Card sort</strong> of existing sections</li>
    <li>Decided on a range of <strong>portals</strong></li>
    <li>Discussed <strong>names</strong> of portals</li>
    <li><strong>Tested</strong> the names of each portal with users</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>The results</h3>
  <p>Out of this process we came up with 13 portals</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Animals</li>
    <li>Fossils and dinosaurs</li>
    <li>Rocks and minerals</li>
    <li>Indigenous Australia</li>
    <li>Online science</li>
    <li>Online features</li>
    <li>Kids stuff</li>
    <li>Teachers and students resources</li>
    <li>Visiting the Museum</li>
    <li>About the Museum</li>
    <li>Behind the scenes</li>
    <li>Collections</li>
    <li>Research</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Legacies and agendas</h3>
  <p>How did we end up with so many portals?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Large amounts of <strong>legacy</strong> content</li>
    <li>Pressure to mirror in-house <strong>department structures</strong></li>
    <li>In-house<strong> agendas</strong></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Portal overload</h3>
  <p>At this point, Lisa Miller and I become very concerned with the 'portal' direction.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Too <strong>many</strong> portals</li>
    <li>Mixing of portal concepts – content and user groups</li>
    <li>Many content sections did not fit <strong>intuitively</strong> into this structure</li>
    <li>Assumptions about <strong>user</strong> pathways</li>
    <li>Concerns about <strong>silos</strong> of information</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Path concerns</h3>
  <p>However, our primary concerns were about user pathways. We wanted to avoid:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Forced, <strong>inflexible</strong> pathways </li>
    <li>Pathways that were based on <strong>taxonomic</strong> or <strong>department</strong> structure</li>
    <li>Pathways that created <strong>silos</strong> of information</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Exhibition floor plans</h3>
  <p>Forced paths don't work.</p>
  <p>Given the choice, people will always follow their own paths.</p>
  <p>When there is no choices available, people will often be resentful.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>A fresh approach</h3>
  <p>We decided to scrap the portals idea and start afresh. </p>
  <p>The question was:</p>
  <p><strong>"How would you organize and structure a large site if you had a totally blank slate".</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Objective 1</h3>
  <p>Allow users to control and determine their own pathways?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>A stripped-back approach</h3>
  <p>Imagine if a site could be stripped back to just three levels of pages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>front page with a search tool</li>
    <li>search results page</li>
    <li>content page</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Sample front page</h3>
  <p><img src="../assets/img-webstock/am-front.jpeg" alt=""></p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Sample results page</h3>
  <p><img src="../assets/img-webstock/am-results.jpeg" alt=""></p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Sample content page</h3>
  <p><img src="../assets/img-webstock/am-page.jpeg" alt=""></p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Tag-a-rama</h3>
  <p>This three-step process could be controlled by tagging.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pages could be <strong>indexed</strong> using tags</li>
    <li>Search results could be based on <strong>relevant tags</strong> </li>
    <li>Instead of creating a fixed side navigation, a range of tag-based <strong>related information</strong> could be provided.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Bird behavior example</h3>
  <p>A "bird behavior" page may have related information like "animal behavior" or "frog behavior".</p>
  <p>Using a traditional navigation system, users would only get bird related links.</p>
  <p>"Related pages" provide users with a more flexible and organic navigation system</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Allowing users control</h3>
  <p>Imagine if users could control their experience more fully by adding their own tags to pages.</p>
  <p>They could be given a list of current keywords associated with any page, then allowed to add keywords that they felt appropriate.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Tagging any media</h3>
  <p>Theoretically, any media could be tagged by content creators and users.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Podcasts</li>
    <li>Audio files</li>
    <li>Movies</li>
    <li>Content pages</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Extending search results</h3>
  <p>This would mean search results would provide users with keyword-based results across a variety of media.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Searching results</h3>
  <p><img src="../assets/img-webstock/am-results2.jpeg" alt=""></p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>A different 'pages'</h3>
  <p>Tags move away from the concept of <strong>pages</strong> as single entities. Pages would become containers for <strong>keyword-based data</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Content</li>
    <li>Related content</li>
    <li>Related images</li>
    <li>Related podcasts</li>
    <li>Related movies</li>
    <li>Related audio files</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Sample tag-based page</h3></div>
  <div class="slide">
  <h3>Entities as pages</h3>
  <p>The use of tags allows images, podcasts, audio files, and movies to become entities in their own right - related but not specifically tied to content pages.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Image page</h3>
  <p><img src="../assets/img-webstock/am-image.jpeg" alt=""></p>
  <p>Objective 2</p>
  <p>Allow users to communicate with content providers as well as each other.</p>
  <p>Comment on anything</p>
  <p>Images, podcasts, audio files, and movies could be set up to allow comments.</p>
  <p>A single website could then host thousands of individual comments and discussions.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Extended collections</h3>
  <p>One interesting benefit is that Museum collections would cease to be static photo galleries. Users could comment on, post images to, and write about individual items within collections. </p>
  <p>The collections could come alive!</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Content creation</h3>
  <p>Another benefit of this single page vs full section approach is that content is easier to create and publish.</p>
  <p>In the past, the Museum would research and then create a wide range of pages on a particular topic. The entire project is only published when all pages are ready.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Objective 3</h3>
  <p>Encouraging membership to increase community involvement and ownership.</p>
  <p>Flickr-like membership</p>
  <p>With a system based on tags and comments, a members section could be created to allow users to track:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Their recent comments</li>
    <li>Their recently 'favourited' pages, images, podcasts, audio files or movies</li>
    <li>Keywords they have added</li>
    <li>Customised feeds from areas of the site</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Downsides?</h3></div>
  <div class="slide">
  <h3>Numerous downsides</h3>
  <p>There are <strong>numerous</strong> downsides to this approach including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Control of keywords</li>
    <li>Moderating comments</li>
    <li>Disparate elements</li>
    <li>No clear pathways </li>
    <li>No expert voice</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Interestingly, many of these revolve around the concept of "letting go".</p>
  <p>Letting go</p>
  <p>A famous Buddhist monk once said:</p>
  <p>"The hardest word for Westerners to say is '<strong>let'</strong>. <strong>Let</strong> it happen… <strong>let</strong> it be…"</p>
  <p>What does this mean?</p>
  <p>Westerners are uptight control freaks!</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Expert voice</h3>
  <p>Many museums and institutions are currently concerned about allowing users to have a voice as it is perceived to dilute <strong>expert opinion</strong>.</p>
  <p>Two examples of this concern in action are the <strong>Sea Slug Forum</strong> and <strong>WSG list</strong>.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Flagging voices</h3>
  <p>One of the quickest ways to deal with this problem is to visually flag and identify comments from experts so that they stand out and are recognised in amongst community discussion.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Site mourning</h3>
  <p>Some people really want an entire sites or section to explore.</p>
  <p>This is entirely valid.</p>
  <p>Ironically, these concerns have often come from <strong>content creators</strong> rather than users.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h3>Wrap up</h3>
  <p>We've discussed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tag-based pathways</li>
    <li>Pages becoming a series of entities</li>
    <li>Commenting and communities</li>
    <li>Membership </li>
    <li>Downsides</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As before, these are ideas, not a solution</p>
</div>
