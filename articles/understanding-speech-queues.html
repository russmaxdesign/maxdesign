<p>To understand how screen readers work — and to diagnose issues — you need to understand the screen reader speech queue.</p>

<p>But before we look at that queue, we need to look at the thing that enters it: the utterance.</p>

<h2>What is an utterance?</h2>

<p>An utterance is the unit of speech that screen readers prepare to output — sometimes a sentence, sometimes a phrase, sometimes only a token like a single character.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focus changes</li>
  <li>AXEvents from the browser</li>
  <li>Live regions</li>
  <li>User actions, such as reading commands</li>
</ul>

<p>An utterance is not spoken immediately. It is added to the speech queue to be processed.</p>

<p>For this analogy, think of utterances as different types of vehicles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Focus events</b> are like ambulances, almost always go to the high-priority lane.</li>
  <li><b>Name and value changes</b> are like ordinary cars.</li>
  <li><b>Typing events</b> (individual keystrokes) are like motor scooters.</li>
  <li><b>Live region updates</b> are like delivery vans.</li>
  <li><b>User-initiated commands</b> (explicit user intent) are like buses that carry priority passengers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the speech queue?</h2>

<p>In this analogy, the speech queue is like a traffic intersection with two lanes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A high-priority lane for focus and alerts</li>
  <li>A low-priority lane for polite live regions and typing</li>
</ol>

<p>More importantly, the speech queue has a traffic inspector. This inspector checks every vehicle before letting it through.</p>

<p>The inspector may decide to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Speak it</li>
  <li>Delay it</li>
  <li>Merge it</li>
  <li>Interrupt something else</li>
  <li>Ignore it</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scenarios</h2>

<h3 class="h4">Interrupt</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An alert interrupts anything currently speaking.</li>
  <li>Alerts travel through the high-priority lane.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h4">Speak immediately</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Focus moves to a button and the screen reader says “Button, Search”.</li>
  <li>Focus events always use the high-priority lane.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h4">User commands</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The user presses a screen reader command, such as “read next line” or “read current item”.</li>
  <li>These commands act like buses carrying priority passengers.</li>
  <li>They jump straight to the front of the high-priority lane and interrupt anything being spoken.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h4">Delay or batch</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A polite live region is spoken later when the screen reader is idle.</li>
  <li>These are cars in the low-priority lane that wait their turn.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h4">Ignore</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Repeated small updates such as rapid changes in a low-priority lane may be ignored.</li>
  <li>These are low-value cars that the inspector pushes aside.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h4">Merge events</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A user types quickly and the screen reader only speaks the final letter or speaks nothing.</li>
  <li>These are motor scooters arriving almost all at once in the low-priority lane.</li>
  <li>There may be too many scooters, arriving too fast.</li>
  <li>The traffic inspector becomes overwhelmed and waves them all through, only registering the last one. In reality, it’s not actual ‘overload’ — it’s intentional debouncing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Screen readers behave differently</h2>

<p><b>Important</b>: The traffic analogy in this article is only a teaching tool.</p>

<p>Real screen readers do not follow the same rules, and they do not handle speech output in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Each screen reader has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>its own speech queue implementation</li>
  <li>its own priority system</li>
  <li>its own timing logic</li>
  <li>its own internal heuristics and strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this, the same utterance may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spoken immediately in one screen reader</li>
  <li>delayed in another</li>
  <li>merged into a single announcement</li>
  <li>ignored entirely</li>
</ul>

<p>This is expected, normal, and part of how each product is designed.</p>

<h2>Why this queue matters for accessibility</h2>

<p>Once you understand utterances and how they move through the speech queue, you will avoid misinterpreting screen reader behaviour.</p>

<p>You are much less likely to wonder why something is spoken immediately, spoken after a pause, merged with something else, or not spoken at all.</p>

<p>Stay safe in traffic!</p>
