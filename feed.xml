<description>A screen reader cannot interact with the shadow DOM unless the browser exposes the internal elements that users can actually operate. To make this work, browsers flatten the shadow tree when building the accessibility tree.</description>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[
<p>Browsers face a problem: screen readers need to understand what’s inside web components. Without flattening, screen readers would not be able to see the real anything inside the shadow root.</p>
<p>But all of that is hidden behind the Shadow DOM boundary.</p>
<p>So how do browsers solve this? To make this work, browsers flatten the shadow tree when building the accessibility tree.</p>

<description>Learn how browsers build accessible names using the idea of an accumulated text bucket, and why some naming rules empty and replace it.</description>
<content:encoded>
<![CDATA[
<p>Throughout Accessible Name and Description Computation specification, you’ll see the term accumulated text.</p>
<p>But what does accumulated text actually mean?</p>
<p>When the browser tries to compute an accessible name — for example, by following aria-labelledby references or collecting text from child nodes — the algorithm needs a temporary place to store the text it gathers.</p>
<p>Think of this as an accumulated text bucket — a container the browser fills with bits of text from different sources before deciding what the final name should be.</p>

<p>This article traces the full lifecycle of an <strong>accessibility event</strong> — from the moment the DOM changes, through Blink’s internal systems, through its internal accessibility tree, and finally back out into the BrowserAccessibility tree that screen readers query.</p>
<p>It introduces the concept of Chrome’s <strong>two accessibility trees</strong> and explains why only one of them is exposed to assistive technologies.</p>

<p>We are often told that the browser builds its <strong>accessibility tree</strong> from the DOM — but what does that actually involve?</p>
<p>This article walks through Chrome’s full AXTree construction pipeline: node filtering, role computation, name/description resolution, layout attachment, attribute mapping, and final AXTree snapshot generation.</p>
